we're doing this in dockerized django

I think for now maintain images as assets in same filesystem as server,


kiss

just django, no docker. postgres as db

home - search view:
textbox + list of recent artwork objects
for each object (artwork + show + buyer + whateber) a detail page, listing its info, with links to associated objects
search bar always on top,
