thoughts:

what do I want to see?
I want:
1. for each model a list view and a detail (form view) - with links
2. on submit of form model creates or updates
3. see options with multiselect for foreign keys

for each artwork, the list of exhibitions it was in
for each exhibition, the list of artworks in ti
for each series, the list of artworks in it
for each location, the list of artworks in it
